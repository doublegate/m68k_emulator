/*
    tests/cpu_tests.rs
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    This module provides integration tests for the core CPU instruction set
    of the 68K emulator. It includes tests for instructions such as NOP,
    MOVE, ADD, DIVU (with divide-by-zero exception handling), and STOP
    combined with interrupt handling.
    
    Each test function simulates a small portion of the emulator's functionality,
    ensuring that the CPU state (registers, flags, program counter, cycle count)
    is correctly updated after execution.
    
    These functions have been refactored to be callable from a public test runner,
    allowing integration testing both from within Cargoâ€™s test harness and via an
    external invocation.
    
    Detailed technical comments are provided below to explain the rationale behind
    each test case, including expected outcomes, cycle counts, and state transitions.

/// the program counter (PC) and consumes the expected number of CPU cycles. Specifically:
/// - When load_program is called with a starting address (e.g. 0x1000), prefetch() sets PC to (address + 4).
/// - Then, executing a NOP (via a fetch_word call that increments PC by 2) results in a final PC of 0x1006.
